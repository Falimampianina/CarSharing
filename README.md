# CarSharing
It is a little program that simulates a very simplified function of a carsharing system, using database, JDBC and the DAO-pattern.
There are two different user, a manager and a customer.
The manager can manage the companies, customers and the cars, adding or deleting.
The customer can rent a car, see if he had a rented car, return it. He can choose the company where he wants to rent a car.
Feel free to test it.
